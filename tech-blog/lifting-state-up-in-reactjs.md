# Lifting State Up in ReactJS

## Introduction

In ReactJS, state management is a crucial aspect of building scalable and maintainable applications. One common pattern used in React development is "lifting state up," which involves moving the state of a component to a higher level in the component hierarchy to share it between multiple components.

## What is Lifting State Up?

Lifting state up refers to the process of moving the state from a child component to a parent component. By doing so, the state becomes accessible to multiple child components, allowing them to share and manipulate the same state data.

## Why Lifting State Up?

Lifting state up offers several benefits:

1. **Shared State**: It enables sharing state between sibling components without using complex props drilling.
  
2. **Centralized State Management**: By lifting state to a common ancestor, you create a single source of truth for the state, making it easier to manage and update.

3. **Encapsulation**: Child components become more focused and reusable since they don't need to manage their own state related to shared data.

## Example

Let's consider a simple example of a temperature converter application. We have two components: `TemperatureInput` for inputting temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit, and `TemperatureCalculator` for displaying the converted temperature.

### Before Lifting State Up

```jsx
// TemperatureInput.js
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const TemperatureInput = () => {
  const [temperature, setTemperature] = useState('');

  const handleChange = (e) => {
    setTemperature(e.target.value);
  };

  return (
    <input 
      type="text" 
      value={temperature} 
      onChange={handleChange} 
      placeholder="Enter temperature" 
    />
  );
};

export default TemperatureInput;
```

In this approach, each `TemperatureInput` component manages its own state.

### After Lifting State Up

```jsx
// TemperatureCalculator.js
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import TemperatureInput from './TemperatureInput';

const TemperatureCalculator = () => {
  const [temperature, setTemperature] = useState('');

  const handleTemperatureChange = (value) => {
    setTemperature(value);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <TemperatureInput 
        scale="c"
        temperature={temperature}
        onTemperatureChange={handleTemperatureChange}
      />
      <TemperatureInput 
        scale="f"
        temperature={temperature}
        onTemperatureChange={handleTemperatureChange}
      />
    </div>
  );
};

export default TemperatureCalculator;
```

In this updated approach, the state (`temperature`) is lifted up to the `TemperatureCalculator` component, and it's passed down to the `TemperatureInput` components as props. Both `TemperatureInput` components share the same state and update it through the callback function `onTemperatureChange`.

## Conclusion

Lifting state up is a powerful pattern in React development for managing shared state among components efficiently. By moving the state to a higher level in the component hierarchy, you can simplify state management, promote reusability, and create more maintainable code.
