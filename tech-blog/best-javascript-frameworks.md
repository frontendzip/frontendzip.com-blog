#  Best JavaScript Frameworks to Use in 2024
JavaScript is a dynamic and interpreted language, it is recognized as the language of the web.

It is a dynamic language that supports a number of programming paradigms, such as imperative, functional, and object-oriented programming. Because of its lightweight design, it is even more suited for the web and is well known for its ability to bring dynamics to static web pages dynamically. However, JavaScript is also used for building server-side applications.

In addition to being used for web development, JavaScript is also used in many other applications, such as desktop applications, mobile apps, and game development.

While JavaScript has been around for more than two decades, it has only recently become a major player in the world of programming languages. Thanks to its versatility and ease of use, JavaScript is quickly becoming one of the most popular languages for both web development and server-side application development.

It has gained traction because JavaScript is one of the many famous and in-demand languages in the IT industry. Due to its widespread, various technologies have been developed around the JavaScript ecosystem, including toolkits, frameworks, libraries, and so on.

This article will introduce to you the best JavaScript frameworks that provide developers with the building blocks to create application software.

JavaScript is in itself sufficient to build any web application from scratch. It has all the necessary library it needs to build whatever feature is needed for your application to function just as fine. However, building these features every time you need to build an application can be stressful and time-consuming, so the idea of a template simplifies the building process.

Frameworks are like a set of templates to build certain features of an application. Instead of building the feature from scratch, you can easily build on top of the already existing structure, which helps developers build even more complex applications faster and more efficiently.

Furthermore, a JavaScript framework is a collection of JavaScript libraries to create pre-written code for everyday programmer tasks.

### What Is JavaScript Framework Used For?

JavaScript frameworks are used to simplify and accelerate the process of building web applications. They provide developers with pre-written code and a structure to work with, allowing them to create complex applications faster and more efficiently.

Frameworks can handle tasks such as data management, user interface creation, and server-side communication, among others. Overall, JavaScript frameworks make web development easier and more accessible to developers of all levels of expertise.

Frameworks can be thought of as the actual skeletal or structural foundation of a larger component. This implies that frameworks—including JavaScript frameworks—are the base upon which things are constructed.

JavaScript frameworks are like flexible JavaScript templates that already have predefined functions that can be called upon to speed up the building process of an application. This can be really useful when attempting to design detailed user interfaces or handling massive volumes of data. You can just use the functions already specified in the framework to avoid writing all of the code from scratch. This can help you save a lot of time and work.

In this section, we will be talking about the different JavaScript frameworks under two categories:

*   Front End Frameworks
    
*   Back End Frameworks
    

### Best Front End JavaScript Frameworks

#### 1\. React

[React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces and is one of the most popular JavaScript frameworks. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers.

React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications. However, React is concerned with rendering data to the DOM, so creating React apps usually requires additional libraries for state management, routing, and interaction with an API.

React is also known for its high-performance thanks to its use of a virtual DOM, which reduces the time required to re-render the view when the state changes. In addition, React offers support for server-side rendering, which can improve the performance of web applications by allowing data to be fetched before the view is rendered on the client side.

##### Pros of React.js

*   Solves the issues of HTML not being a dynamic template with JSX.
    
*   Allows for reusing components.
    
*   React.js is not opinionated in procedures or approaches to a particular implementation.
    
*   React’s functional component looks similar to your JavaScript functions which makes it easy when to learn because you are familiar with it. If you have a proper understanding of JavaScript and HTML templates, understanding JSX should also be easy.
    
*   Google's crawlers require javascript in addition to HTML in order to properly read the document and score SEO. With client-side rendering, JavaScript must be downloaded first, which increases load time and causes Google crawlers to skip over documents. However, with server-side rendering, which React.js offers, it is built on the server upon request and sent to the client, which decreases load time and allows Google crawlers to crawl easily, which boosts SEO.
    

##### Cons of React.js

*   JSX can have a steep learning curve.
    
*   JSX, hooks, and data binding in React are opinionated.
    

##### Key Features of React.js

**Virtual DOM**: Every React component created is converted to a virtual document object model to adapt all new changes before the actual changes are made in the original DOM.

**Cross-Platform**: React native is a custom React renderer that uses native components to create user interfaces on mobile devices (iOS and Android) instead of web components.

**React Flux**: React created an architecture called flux that handles updating the view (React components) on the client-side effectively and follows the one data binding principle.

#### 2\. Vue

Vue is a JavaScript framework for building user interfaces and single-page applications. This is another popular JavaScript framework after React. It is also called the progressive JavaScript framework.

It was created by Evan You and is currently maintained by a team of core developers. Vue.js features an incrementally adoptable architecture that focuses on declarative rendering and component composition. It consists of a set of core libraries that are designed to be easy to pick up and use but also extensible and customizable.

The core library is focused on the view layer only and is easy to pick up and integrate with other libraries or existing projects. The one-way data flow model used in Vue.js makes it very straightforward to reason about your application, and its small size makes it highly performant.

Furthermore, Vue.js uses HTML-based template syntax to bind data to the rendered document object model, and it does this by compiling the templates into highly optimized JavaScript code. All Vue format/templates are valid HTML that can be parsed by spec-compliant browsers and HTML parsers.

##### Pros of Vue.js

*   Tiny size. Vue.js, if downloaded as a ZIP, only ways 18k as compared to other frameworks.
    
*   Simple to learn and is easily adaptable by newbies as they are more familiar with the HTML and JS script, usually in the same file.
    
*   Reactivity in Vue3 is achieved by using the Composition API. The Composition API provides an interchangeable way to set up reactivity that doesn't require decorators.
    

##### Cons of Vue.js

*   Small plugin library system.
    
*   Vue has a language barrier as some of its largest communities are in China, so Chinese developers create plugins and write documentation in their native language, making it hard for other developers to read.
    
*   Too much flexibility in the Vue framework is a disadvantage because of an inconsistent codebase.
    

##### Key Features of Vue.js

**Composition API**: By using the Composition API, you can use redux-like state management within your component without the need for external dependencies. This also results in a more intuitive code structure, making it easier to reason about your application. In addition, the Composition API provides better performance by avoiding the need to create unnecessary re-renderings.

Overall, the Composition API provides a more flexible and performant way to manage reactivity in Vue3.

[**Single File Component (SFC)**](https://vuejs.org/guide/scaling-up/sfc.html)**:** Code might be difficult to manage when it is interpolated from three separate files (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript), but with SFC, it can all be written in one file and utilized throughout your application.

Using CSS in a single file component also makes it easier to keep your CSS styles restricted to just that component.

[**Transition/Animation**](https://vuejs.org/guide/built-ins/transition.html)**:** Vue.js provides an in-built component called transition that allows you to apply animations to HTML documents when they are added or removed from the document object model dom. The transition component is available in every component across your Vue application.

**Computed Properties:** This feature is used to update the UI according to reactive data. It is advisable to use the _Computed Property_ when writing any calculated functions that the UI is to be based on since we probably don't want to repeat ourselves if we need to reuse the function elsewhere in our component advised to use _Computed Property_.

#### 3\. Ember.js

Ember is a component-based JavaScript framework that was created in 2011 by Yehuda Katz. Ember had its stable release in 2016. Ember's goal is to make web development more productive and enjoyable by providing a comprehensive toolset that covers the entire development process by providing a router, view layer, and data management library.

Ember uses its FastBoot technology for server-side rendering for Ember apps. Using FastBoot, you can serve rendered HTML pages to browsers and other clients without requiring them to download JavaScript assets first.

Everything in Ember can be tagged as a service or a component, which is readily available all over your Ember app and can be called anytime. This means that you can have a long file of HTML template and decide to break it into small bits, and these bits can be placed in the `app/component` folder, which makes that bit of your template a component and can be called as a custom HTML tag.

Furthermore, Ember’s routing system has tight integration with the browser’s URL. Ember uses its router to map URLs to a route handler. The router can match the current URL to other routes which are used to load data, display templates, and show the app state.

##### Pros of Ember.js

*   Convention over configuration helps reduce the number of choices to be made and, in turn, reduces error.
    
*   Most Ember apps have the same structure everywhere, which makes understanding a codebase easy within a short time.
    
*   Ember has a dev tool built into the ember-CLI that can be used to x-ray or debug your Ember app.
    

##### Cons of Ember.js

*   It’s very opinionated.
    
*   Learning difficulty is on the high side because things change fast, and when you try to find solutions, more materials are covered in the older solutions than the new pattern.
    
*   Low popularity.
    

##### Key Features of Ember.js

**Components**: You can decide to break large junk of code into smaller units which helps reduce the complexity of code and makes it easier to maintain.

[**Routing**](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/routing/): What sets Ember apart is the introduction of routing, which is used to manage URLs.

[**Service**](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/services/): You can create a third-party service in your Ember app that is available throughout the life cycle of your Ember application, and it can be generated using the ember-CLI.

**Ember Data Models**: Different applications have different models based on the problems they want to solve. An application might have a checkout or cart model, but if the user refreshes his or her application, we expect the data to be persistent and not lost. We can achieve this persistent data using the [Ember Data Model](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/models/).

#### 4\. Next.js

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started) is a free and open-source React front-end framework created by Vercel. It is used to build user interfaces and static websites. The framework is also capable of creating server-side rendering and universal applications.

Next.js uses JavaScript and React components to create the UI. Next.js is influenced by React Router, Webpack, Node ecosystem, and community libraries. The feature that sets Next.js apart from other frameworks is its ability to automatically generate pages based on the file system structure of the project. For example, if there is a `_posts` folder in the root directory, Next.js will generate a page for each markdown file inside it.

This feature allows for a faster development process, eliminating the need to create pages for each piece of content manually. Another unique feature of Next.js is its incremental static generation which allows for statically generated pages to be updated incrementally as new content is added or changed.

##### Pros of Next.js

*   Build static websites fast with dynamic functionalities.
    
*   Next.js stands out for SEO because it offers server-side rendering and the building of static websites.
    
*   Good community support.
    
*   **Fast time to market:** With pre-made components, you may enter the market more quickly while saving time and money. These components can assist your teams in swiftly enhancing and approving iterations.
    
*   **Responsive design:** Become flexible and responsive to ensure that your designs look fantastic on all devices, regardless of screen size.
    

##### Cons of Next.js

*   Poor plugin system.
    
*   Routing is constrained except for an option with Node for dynamic routing.
    
*   When an application contains several pages, the build time is really significant.
    

##### Key Features of Next.js

**Pages**: You can create pages and navigate them on the browser using the file routing system in Next. To use the file routing system create your pages in the pages folder `pages/first-post.js`. The initial route is usually associated with the `pages/index.js` file.

**Image Optimization**: The image component is an extension of the HTML element `img`. It’s improved for the modern web. The improved image component can help resize images on any device and loads the image only when it is in the viewport.

**TypeScript Support:** Next.js provides an integrated TypeScript experience in both existing and new projects. While creating new projects, you do not need any configurations to set up TypeScript.

**Supported Browsers:** All modern browsers are supported by Next.js and IE11 (Internet Explorer 11) inclusive with no necessary design. Polyfills are injected for IE11 compatibility and are only loaded when needed but are usually disposed of during production when not needed in browsers that have IE11 compatibility to avoid duplicates.

**Data Fetching**: Next.js features two types of rendering: static generation and server-side rendering.

*   **Static Generation**: Here, the HTML page is generated at build time, cached in a CDN, and is already built whenever requested.
    
*   **Server-Side Rendering**: In this case, dynamic content pages are generated and served to the client from the server and rendered on every request.
    

**Layout**: If you have to need your Navbar and your Footer on every page of your app, you do not need to add the Navbar and Footer component on every page. Next allows you to deconstruct a page into a series of components, wrapping the Navbar and Footer components on every page.

#### 5\. Angular

Angular.js is a powerful JavaScript-based web development framework. It has been designed to make web development more efficient and easy to use. Angular.js is based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, which makes it easy to develop dynamic web applications. It also provides many features that make web development more efficient, such as data binding, dependency injection, and template systems. In addition, Angular.js is highly modular, making it easy to create custom modules and libraries.

Angular.js allows you to extend HTML vocabulary to create interactivity in your angular application using directives, making the code more readable, expressive, and easy to develop. Additionally, Angular.js includes a number of built-in features such as data binding and dependency injection, which further simplify the development process.

##### Pros of Angular

*   Logic is separated from the view using the MVC pattern, which is most familiar amongst developers.
    
*   Angular is modular, which means when building an application, components, services, pipelines, and so on can be stored in an Angular modularity system called `NgModules` , and these modules can be exported and used to create even more complex applications.
    
*   Reuse of components or using services might need to depend on other services sharing their instances with other components in other components. This is where dependency injection is needed.
    
*   Easy DOM manipulation. Since Angular works directly with the DOM, changes take effect immediately, and a virtual Dom is not required.
    
*   Two-way data binding.
    
*   **Angular is very testable.** Testing hooks are made available by the Testability service and can be accessed from the browser.
    

##### Cons of Angular

*   Understanding Angular takes time because of the intricate web of modules, coding languages, integrations, and customization options.
    
*   Angular is rather complex compared to React and other frameworks.
    

##### Key Features of Angular

**Data Binding**: This is just synchronization between the model and the view. When there is a change in the view, the model is updated; when there is a change in the model, the view is updated automatically at all times.

**Directives**: Angular allows you to extend HTML with built-in attributes with the `ng` prefix. These attributes are used to add interactivity/functionality to your Angular app.

**Dependency Injection (DI)**: A small part of your app can require HTTP service to make backend calls, with the DI system, you can deliver those service to the parts of the application that needs it.

**Templates**: Each template in Angular is a chunk of HTML code and a fragment of the application UI. It is regular HTML but with more functionality.

### Best Back End JavaScript Frameworks

#### 6\. Node.js

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that is used to develop server-side applications. It is based on the V8 JavaScript engine used in the Google Chrome web browser. Node.js was created by Ryan Dahl in 2009 and has since become one of the most popular JavaScript platforms used today.

Node.js applications are written in JavaScript and run on the Node.js runtime, which allows them to be executed on any platform that supports Node.js. Node.js applications are typically event-driven and single-threaded, making them efficient and scalable.

This makes Node.js handle different connections concurrently without having to block the execution of other code in the server using callbacks.

**Single-Threaded**: Node.js uses event looping and single-threaded models. The event architecture makes the Node.js server respond asynchronously, making the server highly scalable compared to other servers.

**No Buffering**: Node.js applications do not buffer data; they out data in chunks.

**Very Fast:** Node.js is built on Chrome V8 JavaScript engine; it is fast in code execution.

#### 7\. Backbone.js

Backbone.js is a JavaScript library that provides Model-View-Presenter (MVP) architecture and synchronization for web applications.

Backbone.js is based on the Model View Controller (MVC) design pattern. The library supports seven components: Models, Views, Collections, Routers, Events, Sync, and Options. Backbone.js also provides an asynchronous communication layer that allows the application to communicate with a backend service.

Backbone.js is specifically designed for Single Page Applications (SPAs). A _Single Page Application_ is a web application that loads all of the resources required to use the application on the initial page load. This eliminates the need to reload the page when navigating to different sections of the application.
